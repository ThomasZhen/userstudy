// --------------- Note for how to change dataset ---------------------
There are few dataset folders. In each folder, there are five files: blocks.json, circles.txt, edges.txt, feat.txt, featnames.txt
Initially, there are these five files in the home directory(the directory where the app.js file is located). These five files belong to the dataset 3980 folder
When you want to change to a new dataset, you have to first drag the five files in the home directory to the dataset 3980 folder,
Then open any one of the dataset folders and then drag the five files to the home directory. 

Just rememeber to put the five files back to the dataset folder that they come from before changing to another dataset.

In case you forgot where to put the files back to, check out the README file in each of the dataset folder, it will tell you where to put the files.
